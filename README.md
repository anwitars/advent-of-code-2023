## About the repository

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023. Most of the time I am not trying to make the most efficient solution, but rather one that showcases how I would solve the problem in a real-world scenario in that specific programming language (except if that language is marked as new to me). You can see how I think using that language, and how I structure my code.

## Why these programming languages?

I have decided to use the following programming languages for the Advent of Code 2023 (will keep expanding):
 - Zig (new to me)
   - I have been wanting to learn Zig for a while now, and I thought that the Advent of Code would be a great opportunity to learn it. I have heard a lot of good things about Zig, and I am excited to see what it can do.

## How to run the code

 - Zig
    - After changing the directory to the day you want to run, you can run the code by using the following command:
      ```
      zig build run < ../../inputs/dayXX.txt
      ```
 - Python
    - Although not necessary, but I use a virtual environment in the ./python/ directory with version 3.11.9 of Python, using pyenv.
    - After changing the directory to the day you want to run, you can run the code by using the following command:
      ```
      python main.py < ../../inputs/dayXX.txt
      # or
      python3 main.py < ../../inputs/dayXX.txt
      ```
